# YOLO
 project of the Research Summer School for Glasgow College UESTC (2019-20).
In this repository,  you could use the OIDv4-toolkit to generate my dataset.


The papers could provide the basic understanding of the algorithms. 


My presentation and report is for the research summer school.


For the YOLOv2,v3 and v4, you could use them to build your object detector, and following the tutorial below.

For me, I use the Google Colab to detect the objects. Here is the Colab Notebook for showing how to train custom object detector and detect objects in images and videos:
